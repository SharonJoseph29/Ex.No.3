# Exno.3-Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques

# REGISTER NUMBER : 212222080049
Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.
Algorithm: 1. Direct Instruction Prompts
Objective: Guide the chatbot to respond concisely to customer inquiries. Prompt Pattern: Prompt: "When a customer asks for the status of their order, reply with: 'Your order is currently being processed and will be delivered by [date].'" 2. Contextual Prompting Objective: Incorporate specific context to provide detailed answers based on the user’s previous interaction. Prompt Pattern: Prompt: "If the customer previously mentioned that they haven’t received their order, say, 'I see that you mentioned your order hasn't arrived yet. Let me check the details for you and get back shortly.'" 3. Persona-Based Prompting Objective: Design the chatbot to adopt a specific persona, making the interaction more engaging. Prompt Pattern: Prompt: "Pretend you are a friendly, helpful customer service representative. Use a conversational tone, such as 'Hey there! I’m here to help with any questions you might have. Let’s get your issue sorted!'" 4. Few-Shot Prompting Objective: Teach the AI how to respond using a few examples, enabling it to generalize for similar situations. Prompt Pattern: Prompt: "Here are some examples of how to handle technical questions: 'My phone isn't charging.' → 'Have you tried using a different cable? If that doesn’t work, it may be an issue with the port.' 'The screen is flickering.' → 'It sounds like a display issue. Have you tried restarting the device?' Now, respond to: 'My app keeps crashing.'" 5. Chain of Thought Prompting Objective: Use a step-by-step reasoning approach for resolving more complex or technical issues. Prompt Pattern: Prompt: "When a customer reports their laptop overheating, guide them through the following steps: Ask if they are using the laptop on a soft surface. Suggest moving the laptop to a flat, hard surface for better airflow. Ask if they’ve cleaned the vents recently. Recommend restarting the device to see if the issue persists. Now, solve: 'My laptop fan is making a loud noise.'" 6. Instruction with Constraints Objective: Instruct the chatbot to provide assistance while adhering to specific constraints (e.g., response length or tone). Prompt Pattern: Prompt: "Respond to order inquiries in no more than 50 words and avoid using technical jargon. For example, 'Your order is on the way and should arrive by [date]. Feel free to reach out if you need anything else.'" 7. Reflective Prompting Objective: Ensure that the chatbot reflects the user’s query back to them before providing a response, reducing misunderstandings. Prompt Pattern: Prompt: "When a customer asks for help, first reflect their question back to them. For example, if they ask 'How can I reset my password?' respond with 'You're asking how to reset your password, correct? Here’s how you can do it.'" Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully.

1. Direct Instruction Prompts
Use Case: Order Status Inquiry

Scenario: Customer asks, “Has my order shipped yet?”

Refined Chatbot Response: "Your order is currently being processed and is expected to ship by May 10. You will receive an email with tracking details once it ships. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"

Explanation: By providing more precise information about when the order will ship (rather than just saying it's "being processed"), the chatbot sets clear expectations. It also invites further engagement by offering additional help.

Additional Scenario: Customer asks, “How can I track my order?”

Response: "You can track your order by visiting [tracking website], where you can enter your tracking number to get real-time updates. Let me know if you need assistance finding the number!"

2. Contextual Prompting
Use Case: A Customer Reports Missing Item from Order

Scenario: Customer says, “I only received part of my order.”

Refined Chatbot Response: "I see that part of your order is missing. Let me check on the remaining items for you. Can you please provide your order number so I can investigate further?"

Explanation: The response directly addresses the customer's concern while ensuring they are prompted to provide relevant information (order number) to move forward. The chatbot acknowledges the context of the previous statement, showing it is actively listening.

Additional Scenario: Customer says, “I have already contacted you about my refund.”

5. Chain of Thought Prompting
Use Case: Troubleshooting More Complex Issues

Scenario: Customer says, “My laptop is overheating.”

Refined Chatbot Response: _"Let’s troubleshoot step by step:

Are you using your laptop on a soft surface (like a bed or couch)? This can block the air vents.

Try placing the laptop on a flat, hard surface to help with cooling.

Have you cleaned the fans recently? Dust buildup can cause overheating.

If it’s still overheating, consider checking for any software or apps running in the background that might be using too much power. Let me know what happens after these steps!"_

Explanation: The chatbot methodically walks the user through potential causes of the issue and provides a structured way to narrow down the problem. This chain-of-thought approach works well for more complex technical issues where multiple factors could be at play.

Additional Scenario: Customer says, “My printer isn’t connecting to Wi-Fi.”

Response: _"Let’s break it down:

First, check if your Wi-Fi is working fine with other devices.

Make sure your printer is in range of the router.
